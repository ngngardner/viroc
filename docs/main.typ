// == Section 1: Introduction ==
= Introduction
#label("sec:introduction")

This document outlines the system design for *VIROC [Vehicle Identification OCR]*. It details the architectural decisions, components, data models, and operational considerations for the project.

== Overview

The purpose of the VIROC system is to provide a platform for vehicle license
plate OCR that allows users to submit images that contain license plates and
receive back result license plate text and associated confidence scores. It is
intended for use in an application stack that requires reading license plate
data from live camera views to enhance customer experience and operational
efficiency.

== Goals and Objectives
// List the primary goals of the system. These should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART), if possible.

- *Goal 1:* To provide a scalable platform for vehicle license plate detection and OCR.
- *Goal 2:* To ensure high accuracy in license plate recognition.
- *Goal 3:* To deliver a user-friendly interface for data submission and results retrieval.

== Non-Goals

Model training is out of scope for this project. The system will utilize
pre-trained models for license plate detection and OCR.

== Glossary

- *API:* Application Programming Interface
- *OCR:* Optical Character Recognition

// == Section 2: Requirements ==
= Requirements
#label("sec:requirements")

This section details the functional and non-functional requirements that the system must satisfy.

== Functional Requirements
Describe the specific behaviors and functions of the system. Use a numbered list for clarity.

1.  *Submission API* - The system must provide an API endpoint for users to submit images containing vehicle license plates returning JSON formatted results.

== Problem Cases

The system should handle clear images of:
- *Case 1:* a single license plate.
- *Case 2:* multiple license plates.

The system may not be able to handle images with:
- *Case 3:* no license plates.
- *Case 4:* low resolution or poor lighting conditions.
- *Case 5:* obscured or damaged license plates.
- *Case 6:* licenses not attached to vehicles, such as those on a wall or in a parking lot.

#label("sec:architecture")

This section provides a bird's-eye view of the system's architecture.

== Architectural Diagram

*Figure 1: High-Level System Architecture.*

== System Components

- *API Service:* A FastAPI service that handles incoming requests, processes images, and interacts with the model inference service.
- *Model Inference Service:* A service that uses NVIDIA TritonServer to perform inference on pre-trained models for license plate detection and OCR.
- *Detection Model*: A model that detects license plates in images.
- *OCR Model*: A model that performs OCR on detected license plates to extract text.

== Technology Stack

- *Backend:* Python, FastAPI
- *Model Inference:* NVIDIA TritonServer, Models from HuggingFace (GOT OCR v2, YOLOv5 [fine-tuned for license plates])
- *Infrastructure:* Docker

== Results

I made a benchmark using 1000 images from the CCPD2019 dataset, which contains
license plates from China. Results saved in 'results/benchmark_results.csv'. I
analyzed the results with for the metrics of prediction time (latency),
accuracy, and Levenshtein ratio (a similarity measure between two strings).
Accuracy measures the percent of time the model predicted the exact license
plate (the model is able to detect the middle dot in the license plate Â·, so it
was removed for analysis). There was no mention of using the CCPD2019 or other
license plate datasets for the training of the GOT OCR v2 model in the original
paper.

  [Accuracy], [64.90%],

)

== Limitations and Potential Improvements

I did not finish implementation for the case where no license plate is visible.
Confidence scores and thresholds would help here, but the parameters were tuned
for performance on the stitched image test case.

Bigger benchmarks are required to determine the performance of the system under load
and also to determine production accuracy. Tracing and other metrics would be
useful. Benchmarks would also allow us to compare and contrast different OCR
models on our metrics, especially with access to production data.

I was unable to deploy the OCR model to the Triton server. If I was building
this application for production I would take the time to find a model that I can
deploy more easily, but this is good for a proof of concept.

The detection model is fast (less than 50ms per image) but the OCR model is
slow (around 1 second per detected license plate).

Multi-plate detection does not use a very good algorithm (seeing if the corners
of boxes are within a certain range of other boxes), needs more research. Also
the parameters are not tuned for dataset performance, rather it was tuned to
pass the test case for the stitched image.
